# House-Price-Prediction
his project involves predicting house prices using machine learning models based on various features like the size of the house, number of rooms, location, and more. The goal is to build a model that accurately estimates house prices for new data.

Overview
Data Preprocessing: The dataset is cleaned, missing values are handled, and features are encoded.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Visualizations and statistical analysis are used to understand the relationships between features and house prices.
Model Training: Various machine learning models are trained to predict house prices, including:
Linear Regression
Random Forest
XGBoost
Evaluation: Model performance is evaluated using metrics such as RÂ², MAE, and MSE
